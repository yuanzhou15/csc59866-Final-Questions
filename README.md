### Multiple choice:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach/philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to ?
- [ ] Uncover underlying structure
- [ ] Extract important variables
- [ ] Detect outliers and anomalies
- [x] All of the above 

In regression analysis, if the independent variable is measured in kilograms, the dependent
variable:
- [ ] Must also be in kilograms
- [ ] Must be in some unit of weight
- [ ] Cannot be in kilograms
- [x] Can be any units 

what is true about an Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF)?
- [ ] It is a step that is carried out after you train a model
- [ ] It is useful to get rid of outliers
- [x] It assigns a probability of to each datum, orders the data from smallest to largest in value, and calculates the sum of the assigned probabilities up to and including each datum. 
- [ ] It helps to group data into batches for a machine learning model.

Which of the following is not true of the normal distribution? 
- [ ] the distribution is symmetrical about the vertical line drawn from the peak of the curve
- [ ] The curve approaches the x-axis gradually on either side of the mean
- [x] The curve is asymmetrical 
- [ ] The measures of central tendency (mean, mode, and median) are equal in value

A residual plot:
- [ ] Displays residuals of the explanatory variable versus residuals of the response variable.
- [ ] Displays residuals of the explanatory variable versus the response variable.
- [x] Displays explanatory variable versus residuals of the response variable. 
- [ ] displays the explanatory variable on the x axis versus the response variable on the y axis.

A fitted least squares regression line,
- [x] May be used to predict a value of y if the corresponding x value is given 
- [ ] Is evidence for a cause-effect relationship between x and y
- [ ] Can only be computed if a strong linear relationship exists between x and y
- [ ] None of the above

If the correlation coefficient is a positive value, then the slope of the regression line:
- [ ] Can be either negative or positive
- [x] Must also be postitive
- [ ] Can be zero
- [ ] Cannot be zero

Averaging the output of multiple decision trees helps to:
- [ ] Increase bias
- [ ] Decrease bias
- [ ] Increase variance
- [x] Decrease variance 

### True or False:

The permutation test, lets you test if two samples have approximately the same statistics (statistic meaning mean or median etc)

- [x] True
- [ ] False 

Solving a non linear separation problem with a hard margin Kernelized SVM (Gaussian RBF Kernel) might lead to overfitting.
- [x] True
- [ ] False 

In the discriminative approach to solving classification problems, we model the conditional probability of the labels given the observations.
- [x] True
- [ ] False 

 Random forests can be used to classify infinite dimensional data.
- [x] True
- [ ] False 

A 1-NN classifier has higher variance than a 3-NN classifier.
- [x] True
- [ ] False 

The eigenvectors of AAT and AT A are the same.
- [ ] True
- [x] False 

Skleran is a library that does not have reinforcement learning
- [x] True
- [ ] False 

Discriminative learning is when we first find distribution probability of data before fitting a machine learning model on the data
- [ ] True
- [x] False 

The goal of supervised learning is to predict the target variables, given predictor variables
- [x] True
- [ ] False
